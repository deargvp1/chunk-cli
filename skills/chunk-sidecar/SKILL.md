# Chunk Sidecar Skill

Run the user's build, test, and validate commands on a remote `chunk` sidecar instead of locally. The 90% job is the **sync → validate** loop. This skill also covers one-time setup (create, snapshot, environment customization).

Sidecars are ephemeral Linux environments provisioned via CircleCI. They isolate work, avoid local port conflicts, and can be reset to known-good snapshots. Your local tree is mirrored to `/workspace/<repo>` on the sidecar each time you sync.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Run these checks in order. Stop and report to the user if anything fails.

1. `chunk --version` — confirms the CLI is installed and on PATH.
2. `chunk auth status` — validates the configured credentials. Rely on the **exit code**: non-zero means a *configured* credential failed validation. Zero does **not** mean every credential is set — a missing CircleCI or GitHub token prints "Not set" and still exits zero. Read the output: if CircleCI shows "Not set", stop and ask the user to run `chunk auth set circleci` before proceeding (the sidecar commands in Step 2 will otherwise fail with an auth error). The command's output masks tokens; do not dig into env vars yourself.

Do **not** run `echo $CIRCLE_TOKEN`, `env`, `printenv`, or any other command that reads credential environment variables. That leaks secrets into conversation context. If `chunk auth status` reports a failure or shows a required credential as "Not set", surface its printed remediation (e.g. "Run `chunk auth set circleci`") and stop.

## Step 2: Find or create the active sidecar

Run `chunk sidecar current`. Three cases:

- **It prints a sidecar** — use it; go to Step 4.
- **No active sidecar, and `validation.sidecarImage` is set in `.chunk/config.json`** — create a new sidecar from the snapshot, sync, and go straight to Step 4:
  ```
  chunk sidecar create --name <name> --org-id <orgID> --image <sidecarImage>
  chunk sidecar sync
  ```
  Read `orgID` and `validation.sidecarImage` from `.chunk/config.json`. Ask the user for the org ID if it is not present in the config.
- **No active sidecar, no `sidecarImage` configured** — full environment setup is needed. Inform the user, confirm the org ID (read from `.chunk/config.json` or ask), create a sidecar, then go to Step 3:
  ```
  chunk sidecar create --name <name> --org-id <orgID>
  ```

Always pass `--org-id` to `chunk sidecar create` — interactive org selection does not work in Claude sessions.

## Step 3: One-time setup

This step produces a reusable snapshot so future sessions boot fast. Follow it whenever a fresh sidecar has no snapshot to boot from (Step 2 case 3).

1. `chunk sidecar setup --dir . --name <name>` — detects the stack, syncs files, and runs install steps on the sidecar.
2. Verify the sidecar is working correctly: `chunk validate`. This uses per-command routing — commands marked `remote: true` run on the sidecar, the rest run locally. If any command fails with a missing binary or dependency, see Troubleshooting below, then re-run `chunk validate` until it passes.
3. Snapshot the working sidecar: `chunk sidecar snapshot create --name <snapshot-name>`. This captures the configured state and returns a snapshot ID. **Always snapshot after confirming the sidecar is working — do not skip this step.** Snapshot names are limited to 255 characters; the CLI will reject longer names before making the API call.
4. Record the snapshot ID in `.chunk/config.json`: `chunk config set validation.sidecarImage <snapshot-id>`.
5. Create a **new** sidecar from the snapshot and set it as active — this is the clean environment you will use going forward:
   ```
   chunk sidecar create --name <new-name> --org-id <orgID> --image <snapshot-id>
   chunk sidecar sync
   ```
6. Re-verify with `chunk validate` to confirm the snapshot-booted sidecar is healthy before entering the loop.

## Step 4: The tight loop

For each round of edits:

1. `chunk sidecar sync` — pushes the local working tree (including staged and unstaged changes) to the active sidecar. You do **not** need to commit or push first. Skip this call if nothing has changed locally since the last sync.
2. `chunk validate` — runs the project's configured validate commands using per-command routing: commands marked `remote: true` in `.chunk/config.json` run on the sidecar, the rest run locally.
   - One command by name: `chunk validate <name>`.
   - Ad-hoc command on the sidecar: `chunk validate --remote --cmd "<cmd>"`.
3. Read the exit code. Zero = pass. Non-zero = go to Step 5.

## Step 5: Interpreting failures

When validate returns non-zero:

- Parse stderr — `chunk validate` prints per-command headers and propagates the first non-zero exit.
- Map error paths back to local files: the sidecar mirrors your tree at `/workspace/<repo>` (or the workspace configured in `.chunk/sidecar.json`).
- Fix locally, then repeat Step 4. Do **not** edit files over SSH — changes will be overwritten on the next sync.
- If the error looks environmental (missing binary, wrong language version, unreachable service), go to Troubleshooting.

## Parallel sessions

When `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` is set, `chunk` auto-scopes the active-sidecar file to `.chunk/sidecar.<session-id>.json`. Two concurrent sessions in the same repo target different sidecars without conflict. Do not override this behavior or hand-edit those files.

## Troubleshooting

- **`no organization configured`** — pass `--org-id <id>` explicitly to the failing command. Read it from `.chunk/config.json` (`orgID` field) or ask the user.
- **Auth errors (401/403, "token invalid", "unauthorized")** — run `chunk auth status` and follow its printed remediation (`chunk auth set circleci` / `github` / `anthropic`). Never dump env vars.
- **Sidecar 404 on `current`, `sync`, or `validate`** — the sidecar was deleted externally. Run `chunk sidecar forget`, then return to Step 2.
- **`permission denied (publickey)` on sync, ssh, or exec** — the sidecar does not have your SSH key registered. Run `chunk sidecar add-ssh-key --public-key-file ~/.ssh/chunk_ai.pub` (or pass `--public-key "<ssh-ed25519 ...>"` directly). The command requires one of those flags; invoking it bare returns "A public key is required." If the issue persists, tell the user they can remove `~/.ssh/chunk_ai*` to regenerate the keypair on next use.
- **SSH key registration or API calls time out (`context deadline exceeded`)** — the sidecar is unhealthy. If `validation.sidecarImage` is set in `.chunk/config.json`, create a fresh sidecar from the snapshot (Step 2 case 2). If not, run `chunk sidecar forget` and repeat Step 3 with a new sidecar.
- **Missing dependency or binary not on `$PATH` on the sidecar** — the environment setup steps may not have installed everything needed, or a runtime was installed to a non-standard path. Use `chunk validate --remote --cmd "<install-or-symlink-command>"` to install the missing tool or make it accessible. Once `chunk validate` passes, re-snapshot so future sidecars include it.
- **`sync` errors about merge base or upstream** — the local branch has no remote upstream. Ask the user to push the branch (`git push -u origin <branch>`) or rebase onto a tracked ref.
- **Snapshot `--image` will not boot a new sidecar** — snapshot IDs are org-scoped. Confirm the new sidecar is being created in the same org as the snapshot.

## Out of scope

This skill does **not**:

- Modify `.chunk/config.json` (that is `chunk init`'s job; user-owned).
- Install or change pre-commit hooks (that is `chunk init`).
- Run `chunk init`.
- Edit files on the sidecar over SSH — they will be wiped by the next `sync`.
